# Memory Management

Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tool.
One way to solve the growing data structure is to convert the dictionary

tracemalloc: https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html

Statistics on allocated memory blocks per filename and per line number: total size, number and average size of allocated memory blocks
Compute the differences between two snapshots to detect memory leaks

Tips:
    Not using "+" for string concatenation (use join instead)
    Using itertools for efficient looping: Itertools Recipes (or can use more-itertools)
    Use built in data structures and functions
